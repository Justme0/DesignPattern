# DesignPattern
The example code from head first design patterns for practicing 

## Singleton Pattern

Your ticket to creating one-of-a-object, for which there is only one instance.

We're taking a class and letting it manage a single instance of itself. We're also provide a global access point to get the instance.

Create a static member instance in class which has a private constructor and using a static function to get the single instance. At the same time, pay attention to the problem of synchronization.

## Strategy Pattern

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
